### Thursday

We're working on Simon's tendency to rush work to call something done and his need to be busy and stimulated. Jack's diligent at sitting down, reading, and doing what's prescribed; in contrast, Simon questions what he doesn't see immediate value in, considers time-consuming tasks 'hard', and then gets bored.

Tying in to the Oak Meadow Ancient Cultures subjects, Simon's reading one chapter from Gilgamesh each day in addition to other reading, building up the narrative that is the basis for many of the Greek stories he's familiar with. The curriculum will soon shift from Hebrew culture to Phoenician; he read an entry in an encyclopedia-style book on ancient civilizations on Phoenica this week as well. We have a library book on Sumeria as well, which is where Gilgamesh originates.

Simon needs some busywork to reinforce the habits of spending time on a subject, slowing down, and forming muscle memory for clear writing and working through problems. I added more math sheets in this morning as well as more spelling words. I've also made his daily task list more explicit, with parameters around time, number of pages to read, and expectations for complete sentences and showing work. A focus on spelling words will continue to be important for Simon.

We picked up some index cards this week to begin putting dates on a timeline. I'd explained BC/AD (or BCE/CE) to Simon earlier this week.

Jack's doing well with creative writing assignments and learning history. Language Arts (vocabulary and grammar) come naturally to him as well. He's comfortable with the "refresher" level math he's doing, as am I. I'd rather see him build confidence than aggressively tackle advanced topics in math. We struggled a bit yesterday with Oak Meadow's assignment to design and conduct an experiment having to do with frog populations in our neighborhood. We reframed that step in the Scientific Method as a 'test' and talked about ways to make observations or study data to uncover results.

This morning we talked through the Scientific Method in detail and talked about why it's important: as a common language for scientists to conduct peer review and so that we can trust science, which should be qualified by peer-reviewed scientific journals.
