### Monday

Still working through specificity of assignments and getting hung up on words, how much, or how fast. This morning I gave the kids projects based on non-curriculum materials:

* A YouTube video from Friday showing the impacts of smoking (health)
* The documentary "Sustainable" about local farms, organic farm, and biodiversity (health, social studies, science)
* A NYTimes article about the Amish embracing some digital technology, and how we moderate our use of technology at home (health, social studies)

Simon read about Sumeria to tie that into the Hebrew and Phoenician culture stories and studies from his curriculum and started working with times tables. Jack did a little bit more with scientific method.
