### Monday

Jack works through his Oak Meadow assignments each week, though sometimes he overlooks a few details.

Simon's keeping up with the bulk of Oak Meadow work, particularly when it comes to reading and writing summaries, and using it as scaffolding for Science and Social Studies topics. For Math we've followed the practice sheets and weekly topics, while continuing to reinforce multiplication facts, place value, and carrying and borrowing. We've gone light on telling time and measurements in the past two lessons, as he did those in school in recent grades.

I also continue to supplement Math with Math Made Easy sheets.

And we've been introducing BrainQuest sheets. Last week we used BrainQuest for Geography. I've got a big batch of Math reinforcement sheets from both books for the topics we've covered for this week, and I've got some sheets from BrainQuest for spelling that'll give Simon a break from just copying/writing words.

November is National Novel Writing Month. I have their books for the Elementary and Middle School grades, and will encourage Simon to focus his energy on developing a character he's written about and drawn through the assignments in that.

At some point this winter we need to kick off some computer/media projects.
