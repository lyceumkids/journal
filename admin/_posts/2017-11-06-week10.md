### Thursday

Simon's memorizing a poem this week for English. We listened to a Wendell Berry poem and talked about repetition of key phrases, that it was a poem without having to rhyme, metaphors and conveying ideas through images, and its impact.

We also talked about fidget spinners being sold at Target containing lead and the company's defenses based on legal technicalities.
