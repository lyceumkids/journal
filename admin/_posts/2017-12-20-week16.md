### Wednesday

The kids continue to watch Bruce Yeaney (sp?) videos on YouTube.

Jack (while sick) watched [America from the Ground Up][https://www.americasarchaeology.org/] this weekend, exploring early American history—Native Americans through the War of 1812, including NYS and Vermont locations—through archaeology. We also started watching the HBO John Adams series, illustrating pre-Revolutionary War events. I'd like to keep these in mind for Simon, too.

General observations: There does seem to be less anxiety for Jack around new math subjects this year.
