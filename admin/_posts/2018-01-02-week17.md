### Tuesday

We looked at the winter events at Audubon VT today. The kids were excited about the Winter Winterness Skills sessions in February, but we talked about the reality of 4 hours there, and that's the week we begin moving.

We decided that next year, when they're both in the ages 9-12 group, will be easier to commit: Just 1 trip a month and they can do a session together.
