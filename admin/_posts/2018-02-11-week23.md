### Sunday

We're moving! And have been busy. At the beginning of last week, Simon and Jack's Nanna was in town. While Jack kept up with his self-led Oak Meadow schoolwork, Simon spent a lot of the previous weekend and Monday working on sewing projects with Nanna.

Simon's also accomplished a tremendous amount of programming in Scratch the past two weeks. Prior to last week, I sat down with him and some of his game concepts and showed him how to change scenes when a character moves from screen to screen, as well as collision detection and various effects. He's really mastered this! It was exciting last week to see that he had programmed elements of a Tetris-like game as well. While it's cold out, and things are a bit hectic, this extra bit of screen time is supporting creativity and technical concepts.

Lastly, I showed Simon how to make songs using Garageband. He's made his own theme music that he uploaded to Scratch to accompany his game. To do so, he's working with a virtual keyboard on screen, composing original tracks and melodies, and doing so to accompany his own creations.

Simon and I caught up on Lesson 22 Grammar, Social Studies, and Science assignments later in the week. He's running about 1 Lesson ahead now in the 3rd Grade curriculum.
