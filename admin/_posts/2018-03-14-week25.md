### Wednesday

Last week I started Simon on Khan Academy for math practice with multiplication facts. He continues to grasp math concepts quickly—we've been doing long division with remainders this week—but I'm trying to encourage fluency in multiplication facts, too.

He found some new stuff with Hour of Code via Khan Academy. We'd done Hour of Code a few years ago with simple blocks programming. This week he's been writing Python code to program a knight character. He's really made great progress with programming and is able to leverage personal interests there.

He encountered some math questions last week that contained variables, such as *Solve for W: 3 x W = 12*. I told him *W* was a variable and he immediately understood that, from Scratch programming.

We reviewed all of the learning objectives/evaluations in his current lesson at the start of this week. I would rate much of his work as consistent. We need to work on paragraph writing, as that seems central to 3rd grade and we're having a hard time remembering the terms *topic, details, conclusion* and consistently writing those. Simon has no problem cranking out written words, but we need to work on structure and how that links to comprehension.
