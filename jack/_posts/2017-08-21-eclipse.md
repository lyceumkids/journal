Today we viewed the eclipse on a telescope. There was a square thing on the telescope and it showed a bright spot on it that was supposed to be an image of the sun. When the eclipse happened the bright spot slowy got covered by a shadow that was the moon. I learned that in some places the sky doesn't darken because of an eclipse.
