Today we went to a wind farm. Its name was Kingdom Community Wind in Lowell, VT. There are 21 turbines and it is owned by Green Mountain Power.

I learned that the tower part of the turbine is 273 feet tall and that a whole turbine weighs 500 tons. I also learned that there are elevators AND ladders. The elevators may be to carry equipment up so the workers can have a safer time climbing up the ladders.
