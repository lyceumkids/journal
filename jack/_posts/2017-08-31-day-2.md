Things to write about:

* What did you do on the computer today? What did you learn?
* What did you practice for music today?
* What else did you do today?
* How many books did you finish since your last journal entry? **Record the number** and write what they were.

***

Today we did Hour Of Code on the computer. I learned event- driven programming.

Today I practiced the songs I learned.

I read a book and played outside.
