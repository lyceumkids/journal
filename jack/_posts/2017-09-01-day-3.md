Things to write about:

* What did you do on the computer today? What did you learn?
* What else did you do today?
* How many books did you finish since your last journal entry? **Record the number** and write what they were.

Today on the computer we did scratch and a typing game. I learned typing better.

I made cardboad swords and armor.
