Things to write about:

* Today was your first curriculum day – What did you study and work on? Be sure to write down everything you did.
* How many books did you finish since your last journal entry? **Record the number** and write what they were.
* Did you practice music or do any special exercise?
* Have you observed your science experiment from last week?

 Today was my first school day. In science I worked on a project about different types of bird beaks and how they help the birds eat different things. I also read and finished a book about Cristopher Colombus.

 I finished 2 books since my last journal entry.

 I did 30 minutes of music practice.

 I observed my science experiment today. There were big white and red spots.
