Things to write about:

* What did you study and work on today? Be sure to write down everything you did.
* How many books did you finish since your last journal entry? **Record the number** and write what they were.
* Did you practice music or do any special exercise?
* Have you observed your science experiment from last week?

*** 

Today I finished my math and started english. We also recorded shadowstick data.

I rode my bike for 30 minutes.

We didn't observe the science experiment today.
