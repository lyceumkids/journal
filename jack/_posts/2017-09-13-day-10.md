Today after I started science and worked on my writing assignment,we went to the Vermont History Mueseum. First I did a thing about George Washington where I wrote everything that made him famous. Then I wrote a speech to convince people that James Wilson was the most famous vermonter. After that we talked about Ethan Allen and then recited our speeches.
