Things to write about:

* What did you study and work on today? Be sure to write down everything you did and the subjects (Health, Social Studies, Science).
* How many books did you finish since your last journal entry? **Record the number** and write what they were. (Over the weekend?)
* Did you practice music or do any special exercise?
* Did you learn about anything over the weekend? Watch any documentaries?

Today I drew a diagram of what happened in the video about the impact of smoking in the MLB. I also wrote about the ways we moderate the use of our technology. Then I drew a plan for the expiriment about how plants grow faster with more carbon and wrote the variables. I wrote about how farmer's market food is different from grocery store food. I also learned the definiton of the word " biodiversity ". I started a book about the pilgrims.

I watched two documentaries. One was about food and it was called " sustainable ". The other one was called " earth " and it was about the world.

EDIT: Jack finished **The Red Pyramid** on the 15th.
