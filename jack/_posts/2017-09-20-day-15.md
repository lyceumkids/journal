Today I went to Billings Farm in Woodstock. We learned about pumpkins and squash. We first did pumpkin bowling, and then we helped make pumpkin bread. Then we estimated the number of seeds in a full pumpkin and then we learned facts about pumpkins and squash. We had lunch and then we made pumpkin ice cream. After that we had pupmpkin jeporady and we tasted the now finished pumpkin bread.

I read 1 book. It was " A Wrinkle in Time ".
