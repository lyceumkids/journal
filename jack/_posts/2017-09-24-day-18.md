Today I went to the Mini Maker Fair. First we went inside. I tried to make a robot go through a maze with Simon. Then I sewed a pillow. After that I went to a place where there was a drill and it was cutting designs into stone. Then I had lunch and watched the champbot challenge and went back inside. I made a copper bracelet. Then we flew drones.

Today I watched a documentary. It was called " Planet Earth ". I learned that there are dormant volcanoes and sulfric acid pools in Ethiopia. I also learned about the mountains in the Himilayas and the Rockies.

EDIT: Jack finished "Throne of Fire" yesterday.
