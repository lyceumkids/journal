I finished my english assignments and worked on my social studies ones. I drew a map and traced the hudson river on google earth.

I completed one project over the weekend. It was to make hardtack.

EDIT:

I finished my English assignments and worked on Social Studies. I drew a map of North America, and traced the Hudson River on Google Earth.

I completed one project over the weekend. I made hardtack for Social Studies, like the Pilgrims ate.

I finished a book since my last journal entry: **Battle of the Labyrinth** by Rick Riordan.
