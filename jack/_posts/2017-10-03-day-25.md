Things to write about:

* What did you study and work on today? Be sure to write down everything you did and the subjects (English, Math, Health, Social Studies, Science).
* How many books did you finish since your last journal entry? **Record the number** and write what they were.
* Did you practice music or do any special exercise? What did you learn?
* Did you do any crafts?

Today I did some social studies work. I redrew my map of North America and bordered the thirteen colonies with green colored pencil. I also drew where the towns mentioned in the social studies book were. Last, I had to write about a time where I felt uncomfortable.

I did 30 minutes of music.
