Things to write about:

* What did you study and work on today? Be sure to write down everything you did and the subjects (English, Math, Health, Social Studies, Science).
* How many books did you finish since your last journal entry? **Record the number** and write what they were.
* Did you practice music or do any special exercise?
* Did you do any crafts?

Today In science I looked at recycling labels on things, drew them, and wrote what they meant. I also worked on a mural of a forest.
