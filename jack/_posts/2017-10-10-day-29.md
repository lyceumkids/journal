Things to write about:

* What did you study and work on today? Be sure to write down everything you did and the subjects (English, Math, Health, Social Studies, Science).
* How many books did you finish since your last journal entry? **Record the number** and write what they were.
* What did you work on over the weekend? (Two craft activities)

***

Today I read my english, social studies, and science. For social studies I colored the new england colonies orange, the middle colonies green, and the southern colonies pink. I also wrote wich area had the most colonies. Last, I worked on a rhyme to help remember the colonies.


I finished 1 book since my last entry. It was **Percy Jackson and the Olymians: The last Olympian**.

I worked on making my halloween costume with Nana and I did watercolors.
