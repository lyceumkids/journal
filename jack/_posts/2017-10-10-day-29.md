Things to write about:

* What did you study and work on today? Be sure to write down everything you did and the subjects (English, Math, Health, Social Studies, Science).
* How many books did you finish since your last journal entry? **Record the number** and write what they were.
* What did you work on over the weekend? (Two craft activities)

***

Today I read my English, Social Studies, and Science. For Social Studies I colored the New England Colonies orange, the Middle Colonies green, and the Southern Colonies pink. I also wrote which area had the most colonies. Last, I worked on a rhyme to help remember the Colonies.


I finished 1 book since my last entry. It was **Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The last Olympian**.

I worked on making my Halloween costume with Nana and I painted with watercolors.
