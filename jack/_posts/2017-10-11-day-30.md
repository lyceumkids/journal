Things to write about:

* What did you study and work on today? Be sure to write down everything you did and the subjects (English, Math, Health, Social Studies, Science).
* How many books did you finish since your last journal entry? **Record the number** and write what they were.
* Did you do any music or crafts?

Today I worked on my rhyme about the Thirteen Colonies for Social Studies. For English I wrote the definitions of words, completed sentence fragments, and corrected run-on sentences. I also completed one third of my science test.
