Today I went to the Green Mountain Audubon Center in Richmond, VT. First I sorted different types of tree leaves into piles based on their shape, size and type of seed. I learned that the real name for a "helicopter seed" is a "samara". Then I identified trees. I learned you can identify beech trees by their sharp, pointy bulb. I also learned that a "compound leaf" is a stick with a bunch of leaflets ( which look a lot like actual leaves ) stuck to it. Then I made seed balls ( or bombs ). You make them by wrapping seeds in newspaper and tossing them in the soil. The newspaper will decompose and the seeds will grow.

I made one field trip to the Green Mountain Audubon Center in Richmond.
