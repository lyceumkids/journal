Things to write about:

* What did you study and work on today? Be sure to write down everything you did and the subjects (English, Math, Health, Social Studies, Science).
* How many books did you finish since your last journal entry? **Record the number** and write what they were.
* Did you do any music or crafts?

Today in science I wrote a list of foods I eat and drew food chains for them. Then I made a food web and wrote how every food chain ends. After that I wrote the roles of Producers, Consumers, Scavengers, and Decomposers and why plants are important to the earth. Finally, I wrote what happens to energy in the food chain, wrote why some people want to eat grains instead of meat,and wrote about diversity.

I did some music.
