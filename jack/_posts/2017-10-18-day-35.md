Things to write about:

* What did you study and work on today? Be sure to write down everything you did and the subjects (English, Math, Health, Social Studies, Science).
* How many books did you finish since your last journal entry? **Record the number** and write what they were.
* Did you do any music or crafts?

Today in Science I drew a picture of a gray wolf in it's natural habitat and it in another habitat. Then I wrote what the cats nearby might do to the birds at the birdfeeder I'm going to make. After that I drew pictures of how animals blend in with their habitats.
