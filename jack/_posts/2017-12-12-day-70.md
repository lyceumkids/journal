Today for science, I made a size chart of the planets and for the test I explained how stonehenge and medicine wheels were similar, explained why the stars seem to move across the sky at night, described how the sun affects life on the earth, drew the eight phases of the moon, explained what causes the seasons, explained the difference between the rotation of the earth and its movement around the sun, wrote the name of our the galaxy and what causes the earth's magnetic feild, sorted the planets into terrestrial and jovian categories and finally, ended with a planet quiz.
