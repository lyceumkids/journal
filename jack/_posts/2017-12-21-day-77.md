Things to write about:

* What did you study and work on today? Be sure to write down everything you did and the subjects (English, Math, Health, Social Studies, Science).
* How many books did you finish since your last journal entry? **Record the number** and write what they were.
* Did you do any music or crafts?
* Let's write complete sentences, reference the subjects we're writing about and check for spelling, punctuation and grammar!
* Have you watched anything about history recently?

Today I worked on my short story about Paul Revere's ride. I'm going to edit and revise it twomorrow. Last weekend I watched a show about archaeology that talked about native americans and different wars.
