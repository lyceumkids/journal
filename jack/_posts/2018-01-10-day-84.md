Today for Science I began a chart of all the food I ate this week. I also learned about hemp as an alternative to using trees and compared recycled paper to regular paper. Then I listed some of the things in the house that were made of recycled materials and some of the things that were made of plastic. I came up with alternatives for some of the plastic things. Finally, I went to the Vermont History Mueseum. There I learned about the year 1816, where it was cold in the summer and warmer in the winter. This was because a volcano in Indonesia erupted and sent ash clouds over Vermont, blocking sunlight. We also played an Abenaki game called snow snakes. Snow snakes is a game where you go outside when the ground is snow covered. It is like bowling except you slide snake-shaped sticks through the snow at a target.
