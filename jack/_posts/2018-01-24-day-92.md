Things to write about:

* What did you study and work on today? Be sure to write down everything you did and the subjects (English, Math, Health, Social Studies, Science).
* How many books did you finish since your last journal entry? **Record the number** and write what they were.
* Did you do any music or crafts?
* Let's write complete sentences, reference the subjects we're writing about and check for spelling, punctuation and grammar!

***

Today for English I ~~did~~ defined my vocabulary words, wrote the contracted forms of words, wrote the original words that made up the contractions, inserted apostrophes into words, wrote the possesive forms of nouns, and wrote sentences with nouns in possesive forms.
