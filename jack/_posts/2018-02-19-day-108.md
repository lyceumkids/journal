Things to write about:

* What did you study and work on today? Be sure to write down everything you did and the subjects (English, Math, Health, Social Studies, Science).
* How many books did you finish since your last journal entry? **Record the number** and write what they were.
* Did you do any music or crafts?
* Let's write complete sentences, reference the subjects we're writing about and check for spelling, punctuation and grammar!

**HAVE YOU READ ANY BOOKS RECENTLY TO RECORD?**

***

Today for English, I defined my vocabulary words, identified subjects and predicates in sentences, and made my own sentences using subjects and predicates.

EDIT: Jack also spent time yesterday evening learning some more advanced options in Scratch for navigating screens and animating his character sprite.
