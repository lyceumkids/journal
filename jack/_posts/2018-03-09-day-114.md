Things to write about:

* What did you study and work on today? Be sure to write down everything you did and the subjects (English, Math, Health, Social Studies, Science).
* How many books did you finish since your last journal entry? **Record the number** and write what they were.
* Did you do any music or crafts?
* Let's write complete sentences, reference the subjects we're writing about and check for spelling, punctuation and grammar!

**HAVE YOU READ ANY BOOKS RECENTLY TO RECORD?**

Yesterday I completed my Science. I also went to the Vermont History Mueseum. First I looked at photos of tourist locations, then I described why someone would want to buy a product on a poster. Finally, I looked at ledgers and a map, also an old shopping list.
