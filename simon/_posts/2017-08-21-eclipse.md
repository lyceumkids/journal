Today there was a solar eclipse. We had set up a telescope woth some sort of thing that showed the eclipse happening. My friend and neighbor Will had came over by suprise. Will had a kind of glasses called solar eclipse glasses they allowed you to look at the sun and see the eclipse. We set up the telescope in the front yard. Also inside Daddy had set up a video of what the solar eclipse looked like in different places.
