Today we went to kingdom community windfarm in lowell vermont. green montain power owns it and manages it. There was 21 wind turbines. At first i fought it was going to be very boring when we got . there we waited a while and then when evry body was there we went in our cars and went farther up we stopped twice and got to get closer up to the wind turbines you could stand about 5 feet away from the wind turbines. The wind turbines wind speed is 8 MPH.
