I played scratch and mario typing on the computer. In scratch I completed 5 tutorials. I made card board armor and sword which we hide in our sleeve and when we need it we use it. Also we went to the library and got out a bunch of books then after dinner we looked in the microscope which was realy cool. I finished 0 books since my last joural.
