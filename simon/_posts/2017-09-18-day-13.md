Things to write about:

* What did you study and work on today? Be sure to write down everything you did and the subjects (Health, Social Studies, Science).
* How many books did you finish since your last journal entry? **Record the number** and write what they were. (Over the weekend?)
* Did you practice music or do any special exercise?
* Did you learn about anything over the weekend? Watch any documentaries?
