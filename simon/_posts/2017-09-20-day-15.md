I went on a field trip to billings farm,The first thing we did was pumpkin bowling,Then went to cook pumpkin bread after that we guesed how many seeds were in a pumpkin and counted. Then we learned about pumpkins and squash and looked at the garden. After lunch we made ice scream and ate it , Then we ate the pumpkin bread and played pumpkin jepardy.
