I went to mini maker fair with Mama,Daddy amd Jack. First thing we did was go in and looked at evrthing inside we made little pillows with jack. Then we went outside and eat lunch then went in again and looked around and went out to wach the CHAMP BOTS after that we went to the drones and flew them. Then i went to a place there where you hit a tub of water and speakers made a noice,

 I learned in a documenterie about montains.
