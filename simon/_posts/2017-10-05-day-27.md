I went to Audubon Orienteering. I first played a game where you lifted a stick with a finger (sounds easy but it is'nt).  After that we played a game where a person was blind folded and had to find a cloth another person.(step 2) fased the other way and yelled where to go when other people could show him where to tell the blind folded person was looking.(step 3) but the people showing could not talk. After thhat we had a snack then went up to the woods to make a map. After that we learned about compassis. After that we played a game where we had to count are steps.

I finished 1 book **Percy Jacksons Greek Gods**
