Things to write about:

* What did you study and work on today? Be sure to write down everything you did and the subjects (English, Math, Health, Social Studies, Science).
* How many books did you finish since your last journal entry? **Record the number** and write what they were.
* What did you work on over the weekend? (Two craft activities)

***

I worked on multiplication and division in math. Then I read "Coming of the Corn." Then I did Journey North. In Journey North I drew a picture and wrote of how I looked at Monarchs and studied them. After that I did spelling and practiced cursive. Then I read.

I finished 3 books since my last journal entry: **The Lightning Thief**, **The Sea Of Monsters**, and **The Titan's Curse.**

I did no music or special exercise.

I did crafts:

1. made a tunic.
2. make a hood.
3. did watercolor.
