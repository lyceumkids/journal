Things to write about:

* What did you study and work on today? Be sure to write down everything you did and the subjects (English, Math, Health, Social Studies, Science).
* How many books did you finish since your last journal entry? **Record the number** and write what they were.
* Did you do any music or crafts?

***

I read Creation and wrote about these puncuation marks (here are the punctuation marks. ?!.). Then i corrected my math and worked on my spelling . Then i made a schedule.

I finished 2 books since my last journal entry. One called **Winnie The Poo** the other called **The Last Olympian.**.

I did no music or crafts.
