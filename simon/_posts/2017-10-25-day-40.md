I worked on Journey North and  wrote a story. After that i did a water cycle and practiced music. After that I killed a enemy army and killed some enemy bonfires in my board game.

*EDIT: I drew a picture and wrote about birds for a Journey North journal entry. I worked on a summary of the book, **The Son of Neptune**. For Science, I drew a diagram of the water cycle. I practiced drums and "Mary Had a Little Lamb" on the recorder.

In my personal project time, I worked on my board game, defeating enemy armies and bonfires.*
