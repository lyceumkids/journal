I worked on three math worksheets  and 1 Geography worksheet. Then i worked on spelling and made a weather chart. Then i worked on a lot of nanowrimo.

I finished 2 books since my last journal entry. Both of them are by Rick Riordan. They are called **The House of Hades** and **The Blood of Olympus**

I did no music and no crafts.
