Things to write about:

* What did you study and work on today? Be sure to write down everything you did and the subjects (English, Math, Health, Social Studies, Science).
* How many books did you finish since your last journal entry? **Record the number** and write what they were.
* Did you do any music or crafts?
* Let's write complete sentences, reference the subjects we're writing about and check for spelling, punctuation and grammar!
* Have you watched anything about history recently?
* **Be sure to list and count all the books you read over break!**

I did directions for a story on how to get somewere and live nicely. 



I finished 3 books one called the city of ember the other one called the people of sparks and the daimond of darkhold.

EDIT

In Social Studies, I reviewed Sarah Whittaker's story. I wrote directions to follow for her move from Wisconsin to Kansas. I made a list of tools her family would need for the journey and to start their homestead in Kansas.

Over Christmas break I finished 3 books by Jeanne DuPrau:

1. The City of Ember
2. The People of Sparks
3. The Prophet of Yonwood or The Diamond of Darkhold (?)
