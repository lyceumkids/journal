Today i DId brain quest and memorized a tree poem. Then I did journey north.

EDIT: Today for Journey North I looked up our sunrise and sunset times and calculated the length of daylight for today. I also explored a Sightings map that showed reported length of daylight at different points in the year in Vermont. In my MLB, I wrote about how the lengthening days impact me and my environment.

I worked on Spelling and Math assignments in BrainQuest.

I read a number of poems about trees for Science, and then wrote and memorized my own.
