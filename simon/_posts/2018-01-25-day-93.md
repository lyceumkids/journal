 Today for science I learned about percipitaion. About percipitation I drew a diagram of how underground minerals and water(I do not mean underground rivers) And how the water turns into water droplets and then it forms Percipitation. Then i did some brain quest. In brain quest stuff. I did some stuff for math in brain quest then some language arts and spelling. Then i read some more of the wizard of oz and wrote it in my book journal.
