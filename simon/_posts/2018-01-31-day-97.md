Today for Science I Learned about how you have the stem of the plant and the plant food in the middle I also learned about the color wheel and how colors mix. I also did a expiriment with celery by putting it in a jar of water that had some food coloring in it. I also estimated what would happed to the celery i estimated this

1. It might mutate.
2. It might change color.
3. It might grow leaves.

Then I did some garageband for music and made some music for a game i have been making on scratch.(:
