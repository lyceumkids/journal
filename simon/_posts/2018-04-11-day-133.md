Today I went to the Vermont History Mueseums and drew a picture of houses and buildings for what one of the exhibits should be like. I also studied old photos of a flood in Vermont. Also this morning I worked on a pharagraph about Igneous, Sedimentary and Morphmemetic Rocks. I also worked on Journey North.
